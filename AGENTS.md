# Agent Instructions

This project uses **bd** (beads) for issue tracking.

## Workflow

- `bd ready` - Find unblocked work
- `bd list` - See all open issues
- `bd show <id>` - View issue details
- `bd create "Title" --type task --priority 2` - Create issue when discovering work
- `bd close <id>` - Mark work complete

**Do not** push, auto-close issues, or take other autonomous actions without
the user's explicit approval.
